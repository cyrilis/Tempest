# Tempest
Douban.fm client for Mac OSX, Writen with Swift and WKWebView

## Intro

Yes, I made another music client for http://douban.fm. It's base on my [atom-shell version](https://github.com/cyrilis/Douban-FM-Express), but written with swift language. It's small(only 7M) and cost less resource.

This swift version of douban.fm client has the save behavior with the atom-shell version, and with the same appearance. Nothing new, but faster(Not fast enough, It's use WKWebView).

If you want see some screenshot, check out [here](https://github.com/cyrilis/Douban-FM-Express).
